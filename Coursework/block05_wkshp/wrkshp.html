    <p> A bear is a large, strong mammal with a thick fur coat. Bears are known for their powerful build, sharp claws, and keen sense of smell. They typically live in forests and mountains, and are omnivorous, meaning they eat both plants and animals.

    <p> A giraffe is a tall, long-necked mammal native to Africa. It is known for its unique spotted coat, long neck, and distinctive ossicones (horn-like structures) on its head. Giraffes are the tallest land animals, with legs and necks that can reach up to 18 feet in length. They mainly feed on leaves and twigs from trees using their long necks, and their spotted pattern helps them blend into their natural habitat. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/giraffe" >More Information</a> </p>
